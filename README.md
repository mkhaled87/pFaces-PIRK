# **PIRK**: Parallel Computation of Reachable Sets for General Nonlinear Systems  

PIRK is a tool to efficiently compute reachable sets for general nonlinear systems of *extremely high dimensions*.
It introduces three parallel algorithms for computing interval approximations of forward reachable sets, based on: component-wise contraction properties, mixed monotonicity, and Monte Carlo-based approaches.

Implemented to utilize the acceleration ecosystem [pFaces](http://www.parallall.com/pfaces), PIRK targets HPC platforms for computing the reachable sets. It has been tested on several systems, with state dimensions ranging from ten up to 4 billion.
The scalability of PIRK's parallel implementations is found to be highly favorable.

PIRK can be used to:
- Compute the reachable sets (or pipes) for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. For instance, in the provided examples [n-links traffic network](/examples/ex_n_links/) and [Quadrotor swarm](/examples/ex_quadrotor_swarm/), PIRK can compute the reachable sets for systems with up to 4 billion state variables.

- Efficiently verify the behavior of systems. Given a fixed time-window and input sequence, PIRK calculates, efficiently, the reach pipe of the of the system in hand. This can be verify that the behavior of the system will not violate the design specification. For now, this requires extra code from the user side to verify the computed reach pipe. In the provided [BMW 320i example](/examples/ex_vehicle7d/), PIRK computes in milliseconds the reach pipe of the vehicle in planned lane-change maneuver, which helps verify that that the autonomously-driven car will not crash into the car in front of it. The result of running this example is provided in the *Getting Started* section below in this guide.

# **Installation**

## **Prerequisites**

You first need to have have [pFaces](http://www.parallall.com/pfaces) installed on the target machine. Once installed, test its installation and make sure it recognizes the parallel hardware in your machine by running the following command:

```
pfaces -CGH -l
```

where the command *pfaces* here calls pFaces launcher as installed in your machine. This should list all available HW configurations (HWCs) attached to your machine. If you see one or more devices, this means you are ready to work with PIRK. In case a device you know is not listed, you may need to install its device-driver or any OpenCL runtime environment that is provided by the vendor.

## Building PIRK

PIRK is given as source code that need to be built one time. This requires a modern C/C++ compiler such as:

- For windows: Microsoft Visual C++ (MS VisualStudio 2019 is recommended and there is a free version called [MS VisualStudio Community Edition]() you can use);
- For Linux/MacOS: any GCC/G++ with C++ 11 support will do the job.

### **Building on Windows**

If you will be using Windows, download the repository and extract it. Then, open the provided VisualStudio-solution file [pFaces-PIRK.sln](pFaces-PIRK.sln) and build it using the **Release (x64)** configuration. Building with Debug configuration will result in a slower operation and requires having the debug binaries of pFaces.

### **Building on Linux/MacOS**

If you will be using Linux or MacOS and assuming you have a GIT client, simply run the following command to clone this repository locally:

```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mkhaled87/pFaces-PIRK.git
```

PIRK requires to link with pFaces SDK, which should be already installed with pFaces. 
The environment variable **PFACES_SDK_ROOT** should point to pFaces SDK root directory. 
Make sure you have the environment variable **PFACES_SDK_ROOT** pointing to the full absolute pFaces SDK folder. If not, do it as follows:

```
$ export PFACES_SDK_ROOT=/full/path/to/pfaces-sdk
```

Where */full/path/to/pfaces-sdk* is the complete path to the pFaces-SDK installed in the machine. Now navigate to the created repo folder and build PIRK:

```
$ cd pFaces-PIRK
$ make
```

# **Getting Started**

Now, you have PIRK installed and ready to be used. You might now run a given example or build your own.

## **File structure of PIRK**

- [examples](/examples): the folder contains pre-designed examples.
- [interface](/interface): the folder contains the Matlab interface to access the files generated by PIRK.
- [kernel](/kernel): the folder C++ source codes of PIRK.
- [kernel-pack](/kernel-pack): the folder contains the OpenCL codes of the PIRK and will hold the binaries of the loadable kernel of PIRK.
- [tools](/tools): some independent PIRK-related tools the that can be used to test the dynamics of the systems.

## **Running an example**

Navigate to any of the examples in the directory [/examples](/examples). Within each example, one or more *.cfg* files are provided. 
Such config files tell PIRK about the system being considered and the requirements PIRK should consider when computing the reach sets.

Say you navigated to the example in [/examples/ex_vehicle7d](/examples/ex_vehicle7d). This examples is provided to compute the reach pipe of an autonomous vehicle making a lane-change manuever in the highway.
To run this example, we launch PIRK with the config file [vehicle.cfg](/examples/ex_vehicle7d/vehicle.cfg). Run the following command from any terminal running on the example's folder:

```
pfaces -CG -d 1 -k pirk.cpu@../../kernel-pack -cfg .\vehicle.cfg -p
```

where **pfaces** calls pFaces launcher, "-CGH -d 1" asks pFaces to run on the first device of all available devices, 
"-k pirk@../../kernel-pack" tells pFaces about PIRK and where it is located, 
"-cfg vehicle.cfg" asks pFaces to hand the configuration file *vehicle.cfg* to PIRK, and 
"-p" asks pFaces to collect profiling information. 
Make sure to replace each / with \ in case you are using Windows command line.

pFaces will take some time (depending on your HW) to solve the reachability problem. The output will be stored in a file *vehicle.raw* which contains the reach pipe of this system. 

We developed a Matlab-interface so that Matlab users can load and use the files generated from PIRK. If you have Matlab installed, open it and navigate to this example's folder. Running the Matlab script file *simulate.m* will use the Matlab-interface to load and plot the reach sets stored in the output file. The reach pipe should loop like the following image:

<p align="center">
<img src="/doc/media/pirk_lane_cnage.bmp" alt="car_manuever" width="170px" height="400px">
</p>



## **Building your own example**

We recommend copying and modifying one of the provided examples to avoid syntactical mistakes. An example in PIRK is mainly some text files. 

## **The configuration files system parameters**

### **The configuration files**
Each configuration file corresponds to a case describing a stochastic system and the requirements to be used to synthesize a controller for it. Config files are text files with scopes 'scope_name { contents }', where the contents is a list of ;-demilited key="value" pairs. Take a look to this [config](/examples/ex_toy_safety/toy2d.cfg) file for an example. The following are the keys that can be used in PIRK. Note that values need to be enclosed woith double quotes.

- **project_name**: a to describe the name of the project (the case) and will be used as name for output files.
- **data**: describes the used data model and should be currently set to "raw".
- bla bla aout other config files parts


## **System parametrs**
