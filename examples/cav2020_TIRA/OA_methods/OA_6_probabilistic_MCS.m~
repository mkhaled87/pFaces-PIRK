%% Monte Carlo-base Reachable Set Estimation for a continuous-time system
% This reachability method produces an interval estimate of the reachable
% set by computing the value of the successor function at a number of
% sample points in the initial set and input set. The number of samples is
% calculated so that the reachable set satisfies the probability inequality
%
%   P(a uniformly sampled initial state and input )

% List of inputs
%   t_init: initial time
%   t_final: time at which the reachable set is approximated
%   [x_low,x_up]: interval of initial states (at time t_init)
%   [p_low,p_up]: interval of allowed input values
% epsilon: probabilistic guarantee accuracy parameter. Reachable set will contain 1-epsilon of the probability measure
% delta: probabilistic guarantee confidence parameter: Reachable set will satisfy the epsilon guarantee with probability 1-delta

function [succ_low, succ_up] = OA_6_probabilistic_MCS(t_init, t_final, x_low, x_up, p_low, p_up, epsilon, delta)
