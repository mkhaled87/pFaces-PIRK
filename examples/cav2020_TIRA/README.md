# Modified implementation of the tool TIRA for the CAV2020 submission


This folder contains a version of the TOOL tira contains the examples that are reported in our
tool paper submitted for the conference CAV2020.
Unlike the original verison of TIRA, this one supports Monte-Carlo simulation as a method to compute
the reach-sets of a dynamical system.
This allows us to compare between our tool, PIRK, and TIRA and eventually report the results in
the paper.
