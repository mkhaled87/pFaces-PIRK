# TIRA: Toolbox for Interval Reachability Analysis

TIRA is a Matlab library gathering several methods to compute an interval over-approximation of the finite-time reachable set for both continous- and discrete-time systems.

## Documentation

The full documentation for TIRA is still under construction, but some element of information can already be found in the [Documentation](https://gitlab.com/pj_meyer/TIRA/tree/master/Documentation) folder.

* HSCC2019_paper.pdf: tool-paper at HSCC19 providing the theory of the 5 main over-approximation methods currently implemented in TIRA.
* TIRA_architecture.pdf: sketch of the toolbox architecture.
* Method_dependencies.pdf: description of the requirement and workflow of each over-approximation method.
* TIRA_user_manual.pdf: work in progress of the documentation, taken from the document submitted for the HSCC19 repeatability evaluation and giving an overview of the requirements, installation procedure and general use of TIRA.
